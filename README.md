üöÄ Enzo's Cyber-AI Journey Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, where I document my adventures and learnings in the exciting convergence of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning!
## üëã About Me

Hey there! I'm Enzo, a 22-year-old Computer Science student from France. My passion lies at the intersection of AI and security, and I'm on a mission to become an AI Security Engineer.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in AI, constantly diving into new concepts and practical applications. Outside of my studies, you'll often find me deep in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and working through Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) labs to sharpen my cybersecurity skills.

This blog is my public notebook, chronicling my progress, insights, challenges, and discoveries along this unique educational path.
## üéØ What You'll Find Here

Here, I'll be sharing a mix of content, including:

- **Cybersecurity Deep Dives**: Write-ups from CTFs, lessons learned from CPTS modules, explorations of security vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies.
- **AI/ML Explorations**: Summaries of AI course content, personal projects, machine learning model insights, and the latest trends in the AI landscape.
- **AI Security Focus**: My thoughts and findings on securing AI systems, adversarial AI, privacy-preserving AI, and ethical considerations.
- **Learning Resources & Tips**: Curated lists of courses, tools, and methodologies that have helped me along the way.
- **Personal Reflections**: My journey as a student, the challenges I face, and how I overcome them.

## üå± My Current Focus

My learning path is currently centered on:

- **Mastering cybersecurity fundamentals** through CPTS training and hands-on CTF challenges.
- **Deepening my understanding of AI/ML algorithms and practical application** through my Master's program.
- **Actively researching and experimenting** with topics related to AI Security, a field I'm incredibly passionate about.
