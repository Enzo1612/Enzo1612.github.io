Welcome to the start of your CTF journey with **OverTheWire Bandit**! This series is designed to gently introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, focusing on command-line basics, file system navigation, and common Linux utilities.

OverTheWire Bandit is an excellent starting point for beginners. Each level presents a small, self-contained puzzle that requires you to use specific commands or techniques to find a "flag" – usually a string of text – that allows you to log into the next level.

This walkthrough series will guide you through each level, explaining the concepts and commands needed to solve them. Remember, the goal isn't just to copy and paste solutions, but to understand *why* each command works.

### **Getting Started**

You'll need an SSH client to connect to the Bandit game servers. Most Linux and macOS systems have `ssh` pre-installed. For Windows, you can use tools like PuTTY or the built-in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The game starts at `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` on port `2220`. Your initial username is `bandit0` and the password is `bandit0`.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
