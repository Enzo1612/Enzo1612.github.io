# Hello World

Today I'm starting my journey to become an ML Security Engineer.

## Goals for the next 2.5 months:
- Complete HTB CPTS certification
- Learn AI/ML fundamentals via Kaggle
- Practice hands-on security challenges

## Current setup:
- Using Neovim for note-taking
- Documenting everything in markdown
- Building practical skills daily

Let's see where this takes me!
